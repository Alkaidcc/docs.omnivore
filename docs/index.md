## Shoutouts :tada:

Omnivore takes advantage of some great open source software:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Most of our backend and frontend are written in TypeScript.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Our frontend is a Next.JS app and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - We do all our data fetching on the web using SWR.
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - We use Stitches on the frontend to style our components.
- [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) - We use Mozilla's Readability library to make pages easier to read.
- [Swift GraphQL](https://www.swift-graphql.com/) - We generate our GraphQL queries on iOS using Swift GraphQL.
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - We use Radix UI's components on our frontend.
- And many more awesome libraries, just checkout our package files to see what we are using.
