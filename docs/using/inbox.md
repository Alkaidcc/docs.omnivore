## Sending PDFs to your Omnivore Email Address

Add PDFs to your Omnivore library by sending them to your Omnivore email address. If there is a subject line in the email, it will be used as the title of the PDF. If there is no subject line, the filename will be used as the title.

::: tip Only a single PDF attachment can be handled at a time. If you would like to save multiple PDFs to your library, send each one in a separate email.

## Creating articles in your library

To create an article in your library, send an email to your inbox address and add `OMNIVORE:` as the prefix to your email subject. For example `OMNIVORE: Ten tips for Using Omnivore`. The content of your email will be added to your library, and the subject suffix will be used as the library item title.
